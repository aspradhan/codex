Homebrew (macOS)

This repository now includes a helper script to generate a Homebrew formula
from the latest GitHub release artifacts. Publishing to Homebrew requires a
tap repository (for example, `aspradhan/homebrew-tap`). Once a tap exists,
you can generate and publish the formula like so:

1) Generate the formula for the latest version:

```
scripts/generate-homebrew-formula.sh
```

2) Copy the generated `Code.rb` into your tap repo under `Formula/Code.rb`
and update the `url`/`sha256` if needed.

3) Users can then install with:

```
brew tap aspradhan/tap
brew install code
```

Notes

- The formula expects release assets named like:
  - `code-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - `code-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- The CLI is installed as `code` and `coder` shims for compatibility.
