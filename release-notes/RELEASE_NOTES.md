## @aspradhan/code v0.4.2

This release sharpens Auto Drive reliability and keeps the TUI's log panes informative.

### Changes

- Auto Drive: add compaction, token metrics, and durable transcripts so long runs stay stable.
- TUI/Auto Drive: celebrate completion with a dedicated state to clarify run outcomes.
- TUI: route browser status logs through the tail helper so log panes update live.

### Install

```
npm install -g @aspradhan/code@latest
code
```
